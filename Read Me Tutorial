This is a beta of hack rom of Ultimate Spider-Man called Ultimate Carnage with extra things are present in demo version Ultimate Spider-Man
I have added Limited Edition Repeat Missions and Finish Game the only disavantage is that during a mission you can't exit this mission only
if you fail the mission appears the screen if you want the exit this mission press yes added in pause menu present also in other versions
toggle hero, i have done the game faster i have bypassed loading screen the game you shouldn't block but more work again but the game should
be stop so i need more time for the stable version my principal goal of this hack rom is playing as with full carnage venom and spider-man
but i have need to change moveset i have tried with hex editor and quickbms script and I got a few positive results by now i can change
the moves of example venom ventent_2 to ventent_4 i have tried to change moves with another characters in this case carnage but I got mess
required advanced tools for this for change moveset of your hero you have to search in the file in example in ultimate spiderman.pcpack with
hex editor the word allanims and that edit the moves example usmpch_1 A8 39 0C 10 50 0B 00 00 E0 AA E4.  A8 39 0C = 3 bytes present in all moves
50 0B = size of data moves this moves usmpch_1 your size is 0x0000B50 so you replace another moves of the same hero spider-man lower than or equal
to at size 0x0000B50  not over otherwise the game could be crash. We have need to change the skins 3d model and i dont know how can do 
having this said that I hope to have been of help regarding the modding of this game all these hack on my pc have worked with this version
for now it is a beta and will be released to short when I have time. Enjoy
